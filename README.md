**UTL-XANDRIA** is a sovereign, self-healing intent-to-code engine. It implements the **UNIFIED TENSOR-LOGIC NATIVE** ontology, turning pure will (Intent) into correct-by-construction software (Artifacts) through a triadic resonance of Void, Fabric, and Artifact.

---

## The Paradigm Shift

Traditional coding is imperative: you tell the machine *how* to do something.
**UTL-NATIVE** is teleological: you tell the machine *what* the outcome must be.

**XANDRIA** is the "Forge" that executes this logic. It features:
*   **72-Operator Canon**: A periodic table of software functions (Genesis, Fabric, Tensor, Interface, Network, Security, Seal).
*   **Active Healing**: Automatically detects and repairs entropy in generated artifacts.
*   **Provenance Sealing**: Every artifact is cryptographically hashed and sealed for auditability.
*   **Intent-Based Generation**: "Build a web app" is all the code you need to write.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20+
- NPM

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshoshfield-a11y/UNIFIED-TENSOR-LOGIC-XANDRIA.git
cd UNIFIED-TENSOR-LOGIC-XANDRIA
npm install
```

### Usage

**1. Generate an Artifact**
Invoke the forge with your intent. You can include Operators (e.g., `OP-10` for Structure, `OP-72` for Seal) to guide the process.

```bash
# Generate a modern web application
npm start -- "Create a responsive web app with OP-10 Structure"

# Generate a Node.js API
npm start -- "Build a scalable node api with OP-40 Interface"
```

**2. Verify & Heal**
The system automatically measures the artifact. If it detects "entropy" (missing files, invalid structure), the **Healer** kicks in.

```bash
# Force a healing cycle
npm run heal
```

**3. Serve**
View your creation.

```bash
npm run serve
# Open http://localhost:8080/artifact.json
```

- [Whitepaper](WHITEPAPER.md): The theoretical framework.
- [Presentation](PRESENTATION.md): High-level overview.
- [Ontology](UTL-NATIVE/ontology.md): The 72 Operators.

## The 72 Operators
The system is governed by 72 immutable operators defined in `UTL-NATIVE/ontology.md`.
*   **I. GENESIS**: Void, Spark, Intent...
*   **II. FABRIC**: Link, Weave, Knot...
*   **VII. SEAL**: Measure, Reflect, Heal...
